# Weather-Application

Objective

The Weather Application project aimed to provide real-time weather updates by integrating with a third-party weather API. The primary goal was to develop a user-friendly application that allows users to check current weather conditions and forecasts for various locations. This project emphasized API integration, data parsing, and creating an intuitive graphical interface.

## Skills Learned

Proficiency in using Java for API integration and JSON data parsing.
Enhanced understanding of GUI development using Java Swing/JavaFX.
Ability to design responsive and interactive user interfaces.
Knowledge of handling asynchronous data updates and API rate limits.
Improved debugging and testing skills for real-time applications.

## Tools Used

Java for backend logic and GUI development.
OpenWeatherMap API for retrieving weather data.
JSON parsing libraries (e.g., Gson or Jackson) for processing API responses.
Eclipse/IntelliJ IDEA for development and debugging.
Git for version control and collaboration
